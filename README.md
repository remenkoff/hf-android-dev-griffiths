## Chapter 1. Getting started: Diving In

Key points:
- Versions of Android have a version number, API level, and code name.
- Android Studio is a special version of IntelliJ IDEA that interfaces with the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and the Gradle build system.
- A typical Android app is composed of activities, layouts, and resource files.
- Layouts describe what your app looks like. They’re held in the `app/src/main/res/layout` folder.
- Activities describe what your app does, and how it interacts with the user. The activities you write are held in the `app/src/main/java` folder.
- `AndroidManifest.xml` contains information about the app itself. It lives in the `app/src/main` folder.
- An AVD is an Android Virtual Device. It runs in the Android emulator and mimics a physical Android device.
- An APK is an Android application package. It’s like a JAR file for Android apps, and contains your app’s bytecode, libraries, and resources. You install an app on a device by installing the APK.
- Android apps run in separate processes using the Android runtime (ART).
- The `<TextView>` element is used for displaying text.
